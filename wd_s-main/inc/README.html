        <h1 id="included-php-files">Included <code>PHP</code> Files</h1>
<p>Use the <code>/inc</code> directory to declare any theme functionality. All files in this directory are imported inside of <code>functions.php</code>. </p>
<h2 id="directories">Directories</h2>
<p>The <code>/inc</code> directory is organized into sub-directories based on the functionality/purpose of the code. These directories can be modified as needed, but the following structure is recommended:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-text">inc/
└─── customizer/    (functions relating to the theme customizer)
└─── functions/     (general functions that don&#39;t fit into any other directory)
└─── hooks/         (theme hooks)
└─── post-types/    (theme post type registrations &amp; functions)
└─── scaffolding/   (theme scaffolding functions)
└─── setup/         (functions relating to the theme setup)
└─── shortcodes/    (shortcode registrations)
└─── template-tags/ (functions that render markup for use in theme templates)
└─── README.md
</code></pre>
<h2 id="filenames">Filenames</h2>
<p>As a general rule, each <code>.php</code> file should contain a single function/action which should match the name of the file (replacing underscores with hyphens in the filename).</p>
<p>For example, <code>function demo_function() {...}</code> would be declared in a file named <code>demo-function.php</code> and stored inside an appropriate <code>/inc</code> sub-directory.</p>
